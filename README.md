# Build The Docs (BTD)

This is a proof-of-concept to provide a 'lightweight' multi-version documentation generator for users that:

- Rely on a git hosting service to handle users and access permissions.
- Need to generate/build documentation in different formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB...) and for multiple versions of a project, using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org).
- Want to be able to generate/build the documentation and have the products optionally deployed to a hosting service automatically.

The most expected use case is:

- Project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).
- Web site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- A GitHub Actions workflow to build the site after each push.

Possible schemes:

- Save doc sources in:
  - A subdir of master/development branches.
  - TODO: The root of a given branch.
- Deploy to, either the same or a different repository:
  - Branch `master`.
  - Branch `gh-pages`.
  - TODO: Subdir docs in branch `master`.

# Usage

This project is available as a Python package ([btd](btd)), along with the plumbing to use it as a GitHub Action. Use the Action for building and publishing the site:

```yaml
    - uses: buildthedocs/btd@action
```

# Similar projects

## ReadTheDocs.org (RTD.org)

This project (BTD) started as an alternative to [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) (RTD.org) for users that don't
need most of the features that RTD.org provides as a service (webhooks, user/team/project management, web frontend or
API to modify settings, etc), because they use a different web hosting service and a CI service, such as, GitHub Pages
and GitHub Actions. See [rtfd/readthedocs-build#35](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs-build/issues/35).

## buildthedocs.pietroalbini.org

There is a Python package with the same name as this project:
[pietroalbini/buildthedocs](https://github.com/pietroalbini/buildthedocs). The development of both projects is
independent ATM, but the same name is used because both tools are meant for the same exact usage. Differences are found
in implementation details:

- The Python package is expected to be executed natively or inside a VM/container which has all the required
dependencies pre-installed.
- This project is expected to be executed either natively or in CI jobs with [docker](https://www.docker.com/). Multiple
[docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/btdi/) with pre-installed dependencies are used to provide ready-to-use
environments for each task.
