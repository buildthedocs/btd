Installation
============

Get the single script version with::

    $ wget https://github.com/buildthedocs/btd/blob/master/btd.sh

or use pipe it with curl::

   $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildthedocs/btd/master/btd.sh | sh -s

Alternatively, get a stable version from `release <https://github.com/1138-4EB/buildthedocs/releases>`_. On top of the single script version, archives (`ZIP <https://github.com/1138-4EB/readthedocs-docker-images/archive/master.zip>`_ or `TAR.GZ <https://github.com/1138-4EB/readthedocs-docker-images/archive/master.tar.gz>`_) are available. These include all the sources and the built documentation.

If using git, this project can be cloned or added as a submodule of yours.
